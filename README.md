# bomberKlee: Adventures

### **Bomber Klee: Adventures**
This is the Source Code of my First Game Called _**Bomber Klee: Adventures**_ 

**How to play this game?**
You are in a small Island with the ability to attack using your small AOE Bomb, but you saw a chest beside you and you want to open it (thats how you clear the game actually)
However this chest cannot be opened for it needs 10 dodoco's to offer so you can open it.
Good Luck on Finding 10 Dodocos Scattered ont he island!! 
BOOM BOOOM! BAKUDAN!!!

_(btw the character used is based on the game GenshinImpact , I do not own the characters and I don't get paid for making this sh*t)_
_(and the tiles used are free assets on [itch.io](url))_
